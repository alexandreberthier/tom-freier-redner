The advantage is that we’ll create a unique ceremony that reflects your personalities. The first step is to see if we’re a good match. We’ll start with a casual introduction to get to know each other and discuss the foundation of your wedding. After that, we can decide if we want to move forward together.

Speaking about our father and hearing the speech at the funeral personally helped me to process my grief. Now, I want to be there for people and families who have to walk the same path. It’s important to me not just to mourn the death, but to celebrate the life of the loved one. There are countless memories worth reliving and carrying forward in our hearts. During the ceremony, I won’t philosophize or share life wisdoms – I’m here for the same reason as you: to honor your loved one.
